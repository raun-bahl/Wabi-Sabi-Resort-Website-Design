					<h1> ABOUT US </h1>
					<div class = "about-text">
						Wabi Sabi is a Japanese philosophy of the acceptance of
						imperfection and finding beauty in it. Life is imperfect, but that shouldn’t stop us from celebrating it the way it is. Beauty can be found in the littlest of things.

						Our resort helps you find peace and calm.Through pottery and other meditative exercises,
						we provide a relaxing environment that caters to your aesthetic of living life the way you want to.

						The artisanal experiences we curate here at Wabi Sabi will help you slow down your life. And it will be life-changing.

						Reimagining inner balance and fluidity to find peace is at the crux of the Wabi Sabi movement. Combining creativity, pottery and meditation - our unique resort situated within a protected post-war town of the Kunisaki Peninsula, pushes our guests to find harmony through our inspired techniques. 

						Through exercises in introspection and vulnerability, Wabi Sabi’s care workers promise to take you through a healing experience, unlike anything you have ever experienced - all in the arms of a retreat that blends into the landscape.

									With Mt. Futago crowning its head and the Seto Inland Sea cradling its body, the Kunisaki Peninsula serves as a spiritual experience just on its own. Verdant forests dotted with well preserved Samurai towns and shrines - the geography of this part of Japan has learnt how to find balance and peace.

									The work that we do at Wabi Sabi takes the essence of this belief forward and pledges our patrons into a new way of life with the help of pottery and meditation. We believe creativity is a channel to peace, and our care workers are trained to take you on a healing introspection through a vivid experience.

									By coupling meditation with pottery, we make the process of tactile instead of purely spiritual. We have come to understand that by interacting with progress, it becomes a part of the way we live. You are bound to carry the Wabi Sabi experience wherever you go.

											Wabi Sabi has done something which no other meditative retreat has done: it has brought creativity to the forefront and fused it with activities and a space so wonderful. It really is quite breathtaking. Would highly advise any pottery and meditation enthusiasts to visit and spend the best of days here!

											Wonderfully curated experiences at Wabi Sabi are ones that are nowhere else to be found. Immerse yourself in the peaceful world of pottery and meditation, spending daytime in dreamy studios and drinking sake at night to unwind yourself. Everyone should try this atleast once in their life, and pottery and meditation folks should whenever their time and pocket allows.
